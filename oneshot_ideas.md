## Momma Murph Defends her Turf
Mama Murph has an extended family of adventurers (the party), and she's asked them to visit her farm.
The local sherif has ignored her illegal potion still for years, but an official from the capitol has come to town to run his performance review. Sadly, this means he's got to shut her operation down. Mama Murph's grandkids aren't going to let that happen.
Make a cool map with multiple outbuildings around a central farmhouse. Give the players time to set traps, then let loose waves of fantasy cops.
Start with a posse of townsfolk and escalate from there. Snatch teams with rogues, animated ballistae to start fires, etc.
You run Mama Murph, and you toss the party random potions throughout the fight. Use a random table to see what kind of buff/debuff each potion provides.

## Timeloop 2
The last time I used this, it became a jumping off point for a Ravenloft game. The players didn't know they were in Ravenloft. PCs had grown up in this isolated town together and were looking to sneak away and become adventurers. Found the perfect opportunity to do so only to encounter this weird wall of mist in the forest surrounding the town. If they went in, it spit them right back out. They camped out by it but woke up back in their beds repeating the day.
The horror on their faces was priceless when later on they realized the mist has only made them AWARE of the loop and in reality they'd been repeating the same day like all the other NPCs for an unknown amount of time. They remembered life before this day, but have no clue how long the loop has been going on. The loop was the domain lord's curse, and now they had to find a way to escape before he noticed he had "company" in his misery.

### **Key Details**:

## The beginning of the end of the world
I DM’d a game where they were at the end of the world and thought they were there to stop it, when in reality they were tasked with creating the next. :
“When I was a boy, I would often read the endings of books first before I read them proper. So that’s where we’ll start. Not at the beginning but the end… of the World”
The Party arrives at the last settlement “Haven” as this world is already dying and these are the last 24 hours. But, when the party arrives at the Last Minute Saloon they’re told by an NPC there may be a way of surviving and reversing fate. Outside of Town there’s a tribe of Nomads their philosophy being “Eternal return, time is a flat circle etc…” and a tall black obelisk.
Upon arriving at the Obelisk a Sphinx will give them all riddles with the answers being keys to various puzzles inside.
Each Puzzle and challenge is based off of The Story of Creation.
Let there be light- A pitch black room houses an altar that needs a special gem placed on it. (I literally just had them pull pieces of paper with effects on them from a blind bag to simulate stumbling around in the dark and setting off traps until they pulled altar.
Sky was created- with the room now having a source of light somewhere in the dark a creature lurks attacking their shadows. So the party positions mirrors to isolate the shadow creature causing it to explode and create the stars.
The land and sea- A figure zooms into the room excitedly commenting on the party on their progress and that they are the next challenge. They’re a speedster and he challenges them to a foot race. (There is no way they can win fairly) but with one of the answer keys (a blank scroll) they can draw geographic features Mountains, Natural Wonders, oceans, cities, deserts etc… to distract him long enough for them to reach the finish line before him.
Animals-They next meet an artist and have a competition to create varieties of life to overcome challenges he makes. How would you design something to love, to kill, to populate etc… just give them an environmental niche to fill and see what they come up with.
Intelligent life- Then they go to a forge to craft golems to rule over the animals they created. Well they have to figure out how to animate them and manage them since golems can only follow a single command. I forget a bit but the gist is they need to use divine magics to impart a part of their skill sets, traits, features etc… into this new species to give them a soul.
Finally they get into a room filled with notches carved into the walls. Standing in the middle of the room is an empty throne. That’s when the NPC that’s been with them since the saloon turns on them revealing that only one may sit on the throne to survive and become god of the new world. Battle ensues and in the end all that matters is someone has to sit on that throne after 6 rounds. If bad guy wins the world goes on, players win their characters ascend to godhood as deities of that new world, if no ones on it well that’s an interesting premise for the beginning of a new world. My players all dog piled on to the throne and it was too funny to not let happen and they all claimed domains in their name. 




\newpage
## Shadows of Deceit

### **Setting**:
- The opulent mansion of Lord Maltrin, a known noble with dubious connections, located atop a secluded hill overlooking the city of Thievesreach.

### **Introduction**:
- Each member of the party, renowned in the criminal underworld, receives a mysterious letter with a golden emblem, offering a substantial reward for a heist on the night of the crescent moon. The target: a priceless artifact known as the "Eye of Elandrial," rumored to be showcased during a secret society meeting at Lord Maltrin's mansion.

### **Main Challenge**:
- While the primary goal is the heist, each party member has a personal, hidden agenda for being at the mansion, intertwining their fates and complicating their mission.

### **Key Details**:
- The mansion is heavily guarded, with magical barriers, traps, and elite sentinels.
- The secret society consists of influential figures: nobles, merchants, and mages, all wearing masks depicting different mythical creatures.
- The "Eye of Elandrial" is believed to grant immense power, but it's also a key that unlocks a sealed chamber within the mansion.

### **Personal Agendas**:
1. **Revenge**: One PC seeks vengeance against a society member who wronged them in the past.
2. **Rescue**: Another PC aims to free a loved one held captive in the mansion's dungeons.
3. **Redemption**: A PC, formerly a member of the society, seeks evidence to expose its corrupt activities.
4. **Rivalry**: One PC wants to outdo a rival thief rumored to be attending the meeting.
5. **Revelation**: A PC believes the society has information about their lost heritage or origins.

### **Encounters**:

2. **Social Interaction**: Blending in with the guests, gathering information, and manipulating events to their advantage.
3. **Combat**: Confrontations with guards, rival thieves, or even summoned creatures protecting the artifact.
4. **Puzzles**: Deciphering the mansion's secrets, disabling traps, or finding alternative routes.

### **Conclusion**:
- As the night unfolds, the party's personal agendas clash, leading to unexpected alliances, betrayals, and revelations. The climax could involve securing the artifact, confronting the society's leader, or even deciding the artifact's fate.
- The story can end with the party escaping the mansion, leaving behind a trail of chaos, or perhaps deciding to confront the society head-on in future adventures.

### **DM Notes**:
- Emphasize the tension of a heist, where every decision can lead to success or disaster.
- Allow players to use their unique skills and backgrounds to influence the story.
- The personal agendas should be intertwined with the main plot, revealing deeper layers of the narrative as the adventure progresses.




\newpage
## Sands of Deception

### **Setting**:
- The desert town of Sandspire, a sun-baked settlement known for its tales and legends, with a mysterious mountain looming in the distance.

### **Introduction**:
- Flyers and rumors circulate about a bard named Lyrion seeking adventurers for a quest of unparalleled danger and reward. The party, each driven by their own desperation, gathers at the "Golden Lute" tavern to hear Lyrion's tale.

### **Main Challenge**:
- Guided by a cryptic children's rhyme, the party must navigate the treacherous mountain dungeon, confront the deceptive Djinn, and face moral dilemmas that challenge their very essence.

### **Key Details**:
- Lyrion, the bard, is more interested in a gripping tale than the party's well-being.
- The mountain's exterior shows signs of a hasty mining operation, abandoned equipment, and eerie silence.
- The dungeon's deeper layers transition from mine shafts to prison-like chambers, with inscriptions hinting at a great power sealed within.

### **Encounters**:
1. **Desert Hazards**: Sandstorms, mirages, and desert creatures challenge the party as they approach the mountain.
2. **Dungeon Traps**: Ancient mechanisms and magical barriers guard the inner sanctum.
3. **Prison's Echoes**: Ghostly apparitions of former prisoners, providing clues or attempting to mislead the adventurers.
4. **The Deceptive Djinn**: Upon reaching the sarcophagus and awakening the Djinn-possessed miner, the party faces a moral and strategic challenge. The Djinn's offer is tempting, but insight reveals inconsistencies in its story.

### **Conclusion**:
- The party must decide who, if anyone, will make the wish. The Djinn's treachery becomes evident when the wish twists into a dark outcome, sacrificing the wisher and reviving the miner.
- As sand floods the chamber, the party races against time to escape. Reaching the exit, they confront Lyrion's betrayal. With the anti-magic barrier in place, they must use wit, strength, and teamwork to force the door open or find an alternative way out.

### **DM Notes**:
- Lyrion's character can be expanded upon, perhaps hinting at past betrayals or his own reasons for seeking the Djinn.
- The children's rhyme can be a recurring theme, with verses providing clues or foreshadowing events.
- The dungeon's design should balance combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving, keeping the party engaged throughout.
- The climax should emphasize the urgency of escape and the emotional weight of the party's decisions.


### OG Storyboard
A bard has left advertisements for the quest of a lifetime. One that only the most desperate must attempt. The players are all the most desperate in some way. Upon meeting at the agreed upon time and place, he explains that he believes to have found the location spoken of in a children’s rhyme, one that promises a wish. He wishes to write a story about the party’s escapades. Past this desert town, the party makes their way to a mountain where a recent mining operation seems to be deserted. There is also a large door with a large lever required to open it. With the party’s help, they enter, but the bard stays behind in order to keep the door open for when they return. The party ventures into the dungeon. Overtime, it begins to resemble a prison. By the time they make it to the end, they open a sarcophagus to reveal a dwarf’s body with his pick axe and helmet: one of the miners that dug to the door outside. It wakes up and claims to be a Djinn inhabiting the body of the miner, and that he offers one wish for freeing him. There are obvious flaws in logic, which an insight check will reveal that the Djinn is lying. The party must decide which of them will get the one wish. By making the wish, it comes to pass in a devilish way, sacrificing the body of the character to the sarcophagus and freeing the miner. The room also begins to fill with sand. The party makes their way to the door for the bard to open, but upon seeing the events taking place, refuses to open it, claiming a story with a sad ending sells better. The door would also be an anti magic barrier, so no teleporting out or summoning aid outside.

- With the Alhoon defeated, the undead's influence wanes, and Stonehaven is saved. The party can decide the fate of the ancient artifacts and the sunken church's remnants.
- Magistrate Elara rewards the party for their bravery, and the tale of their heroics becomes a new chapter in Stonehaven's history.

### **DM Notes**:
- Emphasize the contrast between Stonehaven's vibrant daily life and the eerie nights haunted by the undead.
- The old priest can provide lore about the sunken church, hinting at its significance and the artifacts' powers.
- The Alhoon's motivations can be expanded upon, perhaps seeking a specific artifact or aiming to transform Stonehaven into an undead haven.
- Adjust the Alhoon's power level to match the party's capabilities, ensuring a challenging but fair final encounter.

## Echoes of Legends Past / The unlucky Lich

### **Setting**:
- The quaint town of Willowbrook, seemingly ordinary but home to five legendary adventurers who have chosen to live in anonymity after faking their own demises.

### **Introduction**:
- The peace of Willowbrook is shattered when dark omens hint at the presence of a Lich seeking to expand his dominion. The retired adventurers, each with their own reasons to stay hidden, must now defend their home.

### **Main Challenge**:
- Protect Willowbrook from the Lich's onslaught without revealing their true identities and powers, both to each other and to the townsfolk.

### **Key Details**:
- The Lich, named Morvandus, is unaware of the legends residing in Willowbrook and sees it as an easy first conquest.
- Each adventurer has a distinct past, with old foes and tales that they wish to keep buried.
- The townsfolk respect and appreciate the adventurers for their current personas, oblivious to their legendary pasts.

### **Encounters**:
1. **Dark Omens**: Unnatural events like crops withering, animals acting erratically, and ghostly apparitions herald the Lich's approach.
2. **Subtle Defense**: The adventurers must devise ways to fortify the town, repel undead scouts, and gather information without drawing attention to their skills.
3. **Hidden Conversations**: Covert meetings between the adventurers, where they strategize without fully revealing their capabilities or pasts.
4. **Lich's Assault**: Waves of undead and dark magic assail Willowbrook. The adventurers must use guile, strategy, and limited displays of power to repel them.
5. **Morvandus' Confrontation**: A climactic encounter with the Lich, where the adventurers must balance their desire to protect Willowbrook with the need to maintain their anonymity.

\newpage
### **Conclusion**:
- With the Lich defeated or repelled, Willowbrook returns to peace. The adventurers, their secrets still safe, continue their lives, knowing they've once again made a difference.
- Optional twists: One of the adventurers gets a mysterious message from an old foe, hinting they might have been recognized, setting the stage for future adventures.

### **DM Notes**:
- Emphasize the tension between the adventurers' desire to act and the need to stay hidden.
- Allow players to come up with creative solutions that don't directly involve combat or magic.
- The Lich can have his own motivations, perhaps seeking an artifact rumored to be in Willowbrook or wanting to test his powers against the legends of old.
- The optional level determination adds an element of unpredictability, ensuring each playthrough is unique.
- You can either let them be high level. Or my personal favourite, let all the players roll 2d20s, and the highest role +2 is their level. Let chaos begin
